# LetÂ´s do a SNAKE game

Watch it here:

Extra Challenges implemented:
 - Change the character for the food and maybe the snake:
 Solution: change the third parameter in the lines that draw the food

 - Add a time limit for each food.
 Solution: Add a timer variable, in the main loop check the current time
    and compare it to the time when food was created. If the time is
    larger than limit time then set food to None

 - Create a new screen with more walls after player's score
   reaches 10
 Solution: Monitor the score in the main loop, once the wanted score is reached
 trigger a function to define and draw walls. Store the walls in a list and
 add collision checks in the main loop.

    Function to change to level 2
    This means drawing different walls


    PROBLEMS: This way of changing level layout can have 2 problems not handled here
        1. Snake may be on the wall or immediately crash into wall
        Solution: pause Snake and move it to a safe place to give player time to react
        2. a Food piece may be in the place where the new wall is set
        Solution: Since our food has a life and then it is redefined this is not a big issue
